# The Forgotten Semicolon - Group 6 Visualization Project

## Introduction

The Forgotten Semicolon is a group of data enthusiasts who have been working on a project to visualize car usage data. In this markdown file, we will discuss the work done by the group to create the visualization.

## Data Sources

The group used two main data sources for the project. The first was a publicly available dataset containing information about car usage. The second was data collected by the group itself, which included additional details about the cars such as make and model.

## Data Cleaning

Before creating the visualization, the group had to clean the data to ensure that it was usable. This involved removing any duplicate entries, fixing incorrect data entries, and converting the data into a format that could be easily used for visualization.

## Visualization

The group used Python and its libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create the visualization. They created a scatter plot that showed the relationship between car usage and different factors such as make and model.

The scatter plot was interactive, allowing users to hover over individual data points to view specific details about the car. The group also added additional filters to the visualization, allowing users to filter the data based on factors such as car age and make.

## Conclusion

The Forgotten Semicolon did an excellent job in creating an interactive visualization that allowed users to explore car usage data. The use of Python and its libraries allowed the group to create a visually appealing and interactive scatter plot that was easy to use. Overall, the group's work showcases the power of data visualization in conveying complex information in a simple and intuitive way.
