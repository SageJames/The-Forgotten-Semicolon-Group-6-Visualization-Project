# The Forgotten Semicolon - Group 6 Visualization Project

## Introduction

The Forgotten Semicolon is a group of data enthusiasts who have been working on a project to visualize car usage data. In this markdown file, we will discuss the work done by the group to create the visualization.

## Data Sources

The group used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing information about car usage. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data.

## Data Cleaning

Before creating the visualization, the group had to clean the data to ensure that it was usable. This involved removing any duplicate entries, fixing incorrect data entries, and converting the data into a format that could be easily used for visualization.

## Visualization

The group used D3.js and Chart.js to create the visualization. They created a bar chart that showed the distribution of car prices based on make and model. The bar chart was interactive, allowing users to hover over individual bars to view specific details about the car make and model.

The group also created a scatter plot that showed the relationship between car price and mileage. The scatter plot was interactive, allowing users to hover over individual data points to view specific details about the car.

## Conclusion

The Forgotten Semicolon did an excellent job in creating an interactive visualization that allowed users to explore car usage data. The use of D3.js and Chart.js allowed the group to create visually appealing and interactive charts that were easy to use. Overall, the group's work showcases the power of data visualization in conveying complex information in a simple and intuitive way.
